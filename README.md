## Introduction

This repository contains code and documentation for a machine learning project aimed at predicting real estate prices in Belgium. The project was undertaken for Immo Eliza, a real estate company, to assist in pricing properties accurately.

## Mission

The mission of this project is to develop a robust machine learning model that can accurately predict real estate prices in Belgium. This involves several key steps:

1. **Data Collection**: Scraping real estate data from relevant sources, cleaning and analyzing the data to identify patterns and trends.

2. **Preprocessing**: Preprocessing the data to prepare it for training a machine learning model. This includes handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.

3. **Machine Learning Model**: Building and training a machine learning model using the preprocessed data. The model should be capable of predicting real estate prices based on various features such as location, size, and amenities.

4. **Evaluation**: Evaluating the performance of the machine learning model using appropriate metrics and techniques. This ensures that the model is accurate and reliable.

## Data

The data used in this project consists of real estate listings in Belgium, including various features such as location, size, number of bedrooms, and price. The dataset was collected through web scraping and contains both numerical and categorical variables.

## Preprocessing

The preprocessing step involves cleaning and transforming the raw data into a format suitable for training a machine learning model. This includes handling missing values, encoding categorical variables using one-hot encoding or label encoding, and scaling numerical features to a similar range.

## Machine Learning Model

The machine learning model used in this project is a [insert model type here], trained on the preprocessed data. The model is capable of predicting real estate prices based on the input features. Various algorithms and techniques were explored to find the best-performing model.

## Usage

To use the code in this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the preprocessing script to clean and transform the data.
4. Train the machine learning model using the training data.
5. Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics.
6. Make predictions on new data using the trained model.
